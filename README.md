# Fan Project
The Real Fan Project is a smart control and monitoring system designed to simulate or manage the operation of an electric fan using software and automation principles.
The project focuses on controlling fan speed, power status, and operational modes through a digital interface. By integrating programming logic with user interaction, 
the project demonstrates the application of embedded systems concepts, automation, and software engineering in real-life household appliances.
